### Project: KeepInTouch

KeepInTouch is a desktop app for managing contacts for people in the working industry (recruiters, engineers, etc.) as well as events for career purposes.

* **New Feature**: Tags to be deleted and added
  * What it does: It allows users to add/delete one or more tags from any existing contacts.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the original product can only change the tags when adding a new contact. So changing tags will require deleting a contact and add it again with the new tags which is a huge inconvenience.

* **Existing Feature**: Adapt the `storage` in our architecture.
  * What it does: It allows `storage` to work with newly added feature such as `notes` and `events`. 
  * Justification: Without this adaptation, our product will not be able to store and retrieve data correctly.
