# KeepInTouch User Guide

KeepInTouch is a **desktop app for managing contacts for people in the working industry (recruiters, engineers, etc.) as well as events for career purposes.
KeepInTouch is optimized for use via a  Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, KeepInTouch can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `keepintouch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your KeepInTouch app.

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar keepintouch.jar` command to run the application. (   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.)

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `delete contact CONTACT_ID`, `CONTACT_ID` is a parameter which can be used as `delete contact 1`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `add contact -n NAME [-p PHONE_NUMBER] [-a ADDRESS] [-e EMAIL] [-t TAGNAME...]` can be used as `add contact -n Aaron -p 12345678 -a Baker Street 12 -e aaron123@gmail.com -t Frontend` or as `add contact -n Aaron -e aaron123@gmail.com`.

* `CONTACT_ID` is the number that is on the left of the contact's name in each contact card.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.<br>
  e.g. `[-t TAGNAME...]` can be used as `-t Frontend`, `-t Frontend -t Java` etc.

* `TAGNAME` is case sensitive. For example, a contact can have tags `Frontend` and `frontend` at the same time.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-n NAME -t NOTE_TITLE`, `-t NOTE_TITLE -n NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list contact` and `exit`, etc.) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
